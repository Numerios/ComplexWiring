## Complex Wiring

### Description
Complex Wiring is a new mod for Minecraft creating a lot of possibilities for the player.
Things in this mod are supposed to be complex, but not impossibly hard or tedious as other mod do.
Complex Wiring will also have an in-game documentation method with the final release so you know what to actually do.

Please don't use the very early unstable versions of this mod in modpacks - it may break your precious worlds!

[**Here**](http://complexwiring.numerios.eu) is the *outdated!* wiki with line up of some concepts we're going to implement.
